# INST126-Project-3

Group 27 - Jacqueline Taylor

For project 3, we will be simulating a professional working environment where most of the software and digital activities are recorded using log files. In this project I will have to analyze and generate reports for four areas including suspicious activities, irresponsible behavior, system glitch and domain count. There are a total of 50 users with a log file generated over the month of May 2020. The reports I make will aid in making decisions for the higher officials.  

# Problem Statement and Tasks

1. Suspicious Behavior
Report the total count of suspicious activities. Suspicious behavior is marked if a user has logged into the system more than 5 times in a single day, or if the user has logged into the system anytime between 12:00 am to 5:00 am. 

2. Irresponsible Behavior
Report the total count of irresponsible behaviors. Irresponsible behavior is marked if a user does not logout after logging in, this is checked by seeing if a user has more logins than logouts.

3. System Glitch
