# INST126-Project-3 - Jacqueline Taylor


For project 3, we will be simulating a professional working environment where most of the software and digital activities are recorded using log files. In this project I will have to analyze and generate reports for four areas including suspicious activities, irresponsible behavior, system glitch and domain count. There are a total of 50 users with a log file generated over the month of May 2020. The reports I make will aid in making decisions for the higher officials.
